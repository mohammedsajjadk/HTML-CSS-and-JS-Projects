API URL:

```
https://api.unsplash.com/photos/random/?client_id=${apiKey}&count=${count}
```

# Important point about the API

This API is not free. I think there is only 50 request allowed per day. So, don't use 'npm run start' because whenever you make any changes, it is going to autorefresh the page which means automatically hitting the API. So, while working for this project (especially JS part), just manually refresh the page.
